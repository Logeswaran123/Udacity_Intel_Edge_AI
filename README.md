# Udacity Intel Edge AI (OpenVINO)

These projects are done as a part of Udacity Nanodegree IntelÂ® Edge AI for IoT Developers.

The Scholarship Phase took place for 4 months in which 16,000+ applicants competed.

I was selected as one among 800 winners to be awarded the Nanodegree program.

The projects in this repo are done as a part of the program towards graduation.

Each project is attached with a documentation having description, motivation, requirements, how-to-run and inference from results.

-Happy Learning! :)
