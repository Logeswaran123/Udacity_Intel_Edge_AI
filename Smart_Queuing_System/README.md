## Smart Queuing Sytstem

The project deals with choosing the right hardware for 3 diffrent scenarios.
- Manufacturing
- Retail
- Transportation

The hardware under test are CPU, GPU, FPGA, VPU.

The potential hardware to be suggested must meet the relevant client suggestions for each scenario.

The inference time, model load time and frames per second are taken as the metrics for evaluation.
